Coupling is a measure of how interdependent software components are. This often means that changes in one component, requires changes in all of the components it is closely coupled to. In comparison to [[Cohesion]], Coupling does not imply that the software components are related in their function.

High Coupling -> A change in one component, requires many changes in other coupled components
Low Coupling -> A change in one component, is relatively contained.
