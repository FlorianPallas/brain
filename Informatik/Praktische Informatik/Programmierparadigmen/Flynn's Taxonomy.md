{Single, Multiple} Instruction/Program x {Single, Multiple} Data
-> SISD, SIMD, MIMD, MISD

## SISD
A single instruction stream operates on a single memory
e.g. [[Von Neumann Architecture]]

## SIMD
One Instruction is applied on homogeneous data, like an array
e.g. Vector Processors of early supercomputers

MIMD
Different processors operate on different data
e.g. Multi-core processors

MISD
Multiple instructions are executed simultaneously on the same data
e.g. Modern processor pipelines
